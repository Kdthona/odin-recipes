        <p>Fried eggs are delicious, crispy, and rich additions to breakfast, lunch or dinner.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of a neutral oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a skillet to medium heat.</li>

            <li>Place the oil in the pan.</li>

            <li>Crack the egg into the pan being careful not to break the yolk if possible.</li>

            <li>Gently break up the egg whites surrounding the yolk with a fork. This will allow those whites to cook quicker and more evenly with the rest of the egg.</li>

            <li>Optionally, you can also add some water to the skillet and cover for the steam to help cook the whites.</li>

            <li>Once the whites are cooked, and the edge of the egg is crisp to your liking, remove the egg from the pan.</li>
        </ol>
